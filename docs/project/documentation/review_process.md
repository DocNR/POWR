# Documentation Review Process

**Last Updated:** 2025-03-26  
**Status:** Active  
**Related To:** Documentation Standards, Quality Assurance

## Purpose

This document guides a thorough review of the POWR app documentation against the current codebase, with special focus on ensuring alignment with our MVP plan. This review process ensures our documentation accurately reflects implementation details, architectural decisions, and development priorities.

## Review Process

### 1. Documentation Inventory Assessment
First, review all existing documentation to establish a baseline:

- Identify all documentation files across the repository
- Categorize by type (architecture, feature specs, API definitions, implementation guides)
- Note document creation/modification dates
- List key documentation gaps (undocumented components, features, or interfaces)

### 2. MVP Alignment Review
With [MVP and Targeted Rebuild](../mvp_and_rebuild.md) as your primary reference:

- Verify all MVP features are clearly documented with implementation plans
- Confirm that targeted rebuilds are thoroughly specified with rationale and approach
- Assess whether each component marked for rebuild has adequate technical documentation
- Identify any contradictions between the MVP plan and other documentation
- Validate phasing and prioritization details match across all documents

### 3. Code-Documentation Accuracy Assessment
For each key component identified in the MVP plan:

- Compare component documentation against actual implementation
- Review interface definitions for accuracy
- Verify architectural diagrams match actual code organization
- Check that documented dependencies reflect actual imports
- Confirm data flow descriptions match the implemented patterns
- Validate hook usage patterns match documentation

### 4. Social Feature Documentation Deep-Dive
Since social features need significant attention in our MVP:

- Analyze NDK implementation against [NDK Comprehensive Guide](../../technical/ndk/comprehensive_guide.md)
- Verify relay management documentation matches implementation
- Validate subscription handling patterns against best practices
- Confirm authentication flows match documentation
- Check caching strategy implementation against documentation
- Assess error handling and offline support implementations

### 5. Component-Level Documentation Check
For each major component:

- Compare props/interfaces in code vs. documentation
- Verify state management patterns match documentation
- Confirm component lifecycle handling follows documented patterns
- Assess whether component relationships are accurately documented
- Check that component rendering optimizations are documented

### 6. Hook and Service Documentation Validation
For all custom hooks and services:

- Verify parameter and return type documentation
- Confirm usage examples are accurate and up-to-date
- Check that documented side effects match implementation
- Validate error handling patterns match documentation
- Ensure dependencies are correctly documented

### 7. Documentation Update Plan
Based on the review, create a prioritized update plan:

- List documentation that requires immediate updates (high priority)
- Identify documentation needing moderate updates (medium priority)
- Note documentation requiring minor corrections (low priority)
- Suggest new documentation needed to support the MVP implementation
- Recommend documentation that can be deprecated or archived

## Review Questions

For each document, answer these key questions:

1. **Accuracy**: Does this document accurately reflect the current codebase implementation?
2. **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects of the feature/component?
3. **Consistency**: Is it consistent with the MVP and Targeted Rebuild plan and other documents?
4. **Clarity**: Is the information presented clearly for developers to understand?
5. **Actionability**: Does it provide clear guidance for implementation work?
6. **Relevance**: Is this documentation still relevant to our MVP goals?
7. **Technical Detail**: Does it provide sufficient technical details for implementation?
8. **Examples**: Are code examples current and functional?
9. **Edge Cases**: Does it address important edge cases and error scenarios?
