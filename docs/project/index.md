## Contents

## Documentation Process

The POWR app has a standardized documentation process to ensure high-quality, consistent documentation:

- [Documentation Organization Plan](./documentation/organization_plan.md) - The overall strategy for organizing documentation
- [Documentation Review Process](./documentation/review_process.md) - How to review documentation for quality and accuracy
- [Documentation Implementation Script](./documentation/implementation_script.md) - Step-by-step guide for implementing the documentation reorganization
- [Documentation Migration Mapping](./documentation/migration_mapping.md) - Tracking the migration of documentation files
- [Documentation Standards](./documentation/standards.md) - Standards for documentation content and formatting

## Project Roadmap

The POWR app development follows a multi-horizon planning approach:

### Near-Term: [MVP and Targeted Rebuild](./mvp_and_rebuild.md)
1. Core functionality for the Minimum Viable Product
2. Areas targeted for rebuilding or enhancement
3. Prioritization of features and components
4. Development phases and milestones

### Extended Vision: [Long-Term Roadmap](./long_term_roadmap.md)
1. Strategic pillars and product vision
2. Feature roadmap beyond MVP
3. Technical architecture evolution
4. Growth strategy and metrics

Both roadmaps are continuously updated as the project progresses, with input from user feedback and stakeholder requirements.
