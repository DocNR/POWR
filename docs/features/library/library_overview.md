## Overview

The Library tab serves as the centralized hub for managing fitness content in the POWR app, including exercises and workout templates. It provides an organized, searchable interface that supports both locally created content and Nostr-based discovery while maintaining offline usability.

## Key Components

### Navigation Structure

The Library is organized into three main sections using Material Top Tabs:

1. **Templates (Default Tab)** - Workout templates for quick start
2. **Exercises** - Individual exercise library
3. **Programs** - Multi-day workout programs (placeholder for future)
