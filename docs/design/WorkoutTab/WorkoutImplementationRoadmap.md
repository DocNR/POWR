## Implementation Approach

### Vertical Slices
Each phase will implement features as complete vertical slices, ensuring working functionality at each stage. This approach allows for:

1. Earlier user testing and feedback
2. Incremental value delivery
3. More flexible priorities
4. Easier integration testing

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core logic components
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for data flow
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for timer accuracy

### Quality Gates
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:
1. All tests passing
2. Performance benchmarks met
3. No regressions in existing functionality
4. Technical debt documented
5. Documentation updated

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1-2 React Native developers
- 1 Designer for UI components
- Testing support

### Technical Resources
- Test devices (iOS/Android)
- Performance monitoring setup
- SQLite optimization tools
- Animation prototyping tools

### External Dependencies
- Nostr SDK updates if needed
- Any third-party libraries for specific features
- Design system extensions

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Timer Accuracy** - Mobile timers may drift or be affected by background state
   - *Mitigation:* Use requestAnimationFrame and background-aware implementations
   
2. **Database Performance** - Large workout histories may impact query speed
   - *Mitigation:* Implement pagination, indexing, and query optimization
   
3. **Cross-platform Consistency** - UI/interaction differences between iOS/Android/web
   - *Mitigation:* Platform-specific adaptations while maintaining consistent data model
   
4. **Offline Sync Conflicts** - Multi-device usage may cause data conflicts
   - *Mitigation:* Implement conflict resolution strategies and versioning

5. **Battery Usage** - Continuous timing and tracking may impact battery life
   - *Mitigation:* Optimize refresh rates, background processes, and sensor usage

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Workout completion rate
- Average workout duration
