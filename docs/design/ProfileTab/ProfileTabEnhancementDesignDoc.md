# Profile Tab Enhancement Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of the enhanced Profile tab for the POWR app. The enhancement includes a tabbed interface with separate screens for profile overview, activity feed, progress analytics, and settings.

## Motivation

The original Profile tab was limited to displaying basic user information. With the growing social and analytics features of the app, we need a more comprehensive profile experience that:

1. Showcases the user's identity and achievements
2. Displays workout activity in a social feed format
3. Provides analytics and progress tracking
4. Offers easy access to settings and preferences

By moving analytics and progress tracking to the Profile tab, we create a more cohesive user experience that focuses on personal growth and achievement.

## Design

### Tab Structure

The enhanced Profile tab is organized into four sub-tabs:

1. **Overview**: Displays user profile information, stats summary, and quick access to recent records and activity
2. **Activity**: Shows a chronological feed of the user's workout posts
3. **Progress**: Provides analytics and progress tracking with charts and personal records
4. **Settings**: Contains profile editing, privacy controls, and app preferences

### Navigation

The tabs are implemented using Expo Router's `Tabs` component, with appropriate icons for each tab:

- Overview: User icon
- Activity: Activity icon
- Progress: BarChart2 icon
- Settings: Settings icon

### Data Flow

The Profile tab components interact with several services:

1. **NDK Services**: For user profile data and authentication
2. **WorkoutService**: For accessing workout history
3. **AnalyticsService**: For calculating statistics and progress metrics

## Implementation Details

### New Components and Files

1. **Tab Layout**:
   - `app/(tabs)/profile/_layout.tsx`: Defines the tab structure and navigation

2. **Tab Screens**:
   - `app/(tabs)/profile/overview.tsx`: Profile information and summary
   - `app/(tabs)/profile/activity.tsx`: Workout activity feed
   - `app/(tabs)/profile/progress.tsx`: Analytics and progress tracking
   - `app/(tabs)/profile/settings.tsx`: User settings and preferences

3. **Services**:
   - `lib/services/AnalyticsService.ts`: Service for calculating workout statistics and progress data
   - `lib/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`: React hook for accessing the analytics service

### Analytics Service

The AnalyticsService provides methods for:

1. **Workout Statistics**: Calculate aggregate statistics like total workouts, duration, volume, etc.
2. **Exercise Progress**: Track progress for specific exercises over time
3. **Personal Records**: Identify and track personal records for exercises

The service is designed to work with both local and Nostr-based workout data, providing a unified view of the user's progress.

### Authentication Integration

The Profile tab is integrated with the Nostr authentication system:

- Unauthenticated users see a login prompt in the Overview tab
- All tabs show appropriate UI for unauthenticated users
- The NostrLoginSheet is accessible from the Overview tab

## User Experience

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a comprehensive view of the user's profile:

- Profile picture and banner image
- Display name and username
- About/bio text
- Summary statistics (workouts, templates, programs)
- Recent personal records
- Recent activity
- Quick actions for profile management

### Activity Tab

The Activity tab displays the user's workout posts in a chronological feed:

- Each post shows the workout details
- Posts are formatted similar to the social feed
- Empty state for users with no activity

### Progress Tab

The Progress tab visualizes the user's fitness journey:

- Period selector (week, month, year, all-time)
- Workout summary statistics
- Workout frequency chart
- Exercise distribution chart
- Personal records list
- Empty states for users with no data

### Settings Tab

The Settings tab provides access to user preferences:

- Profile information editing
- Privacy settings
- Notification preferences
- Account management

## Future Enhancements

1. **Workout Streaks**: Track and display workout consistency
2. **Goal Setting**: Allow users to set and track fitness goals
3. **Comparison Analytics**: Compare current performance with past periods
4. **Social Integration**: Show followers/following counts and management
5. **Achievement Badges**: Gamification elements for workout milestones

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- The AnalyticsService uses caching to minimize recalculations
- Data is loaded asynchronously to keep the UI responsive
- Charts and visualizations use efficient rendering techniques

### Data Privacy

- Analytics are calculated locally on the device
- Sharing controls allow users to decide what data is public
- Personal records can be selectively shared

## Conclusion

The enhanced Profile tab transforms the user experience by providing a comprehensive view of the user's identity, activity, and progress. By centralizing these features in the Profile tab, we create a more intuitive and engaging experience that encourages users to track their fitness journey and celebrate their achievements.
