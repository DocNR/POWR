# React Query Integration - Executive Summary

**Last Updated:** April 3, 2025

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of our plan to integrate React Query (TanStack Query) into the POWR app to address critical issues with authentication state transitions, hook ordering problems, and to enhance our offline synchronization capabilities.

## Current Challenges

1. **Authentication State Transition Issues**
   - UI freezes during auth transitions, especially with Amber signer
   - Crashes caused by React hook ordering violations when auth state changes
   - Inconsistent component behavior during sign-in/sign-out operations

2. **Data Synchronization Challenges**
   - Ad-hoc caching logic across components
   - Inconsistent offline handling
   - Difficult conflict resolution

3. **Code Maintenance Problems**
   - Duplicate loading/error state handling
   - Complex conditional rendering based on auth state
   - Disparate approaches to data fetching and caching

## Proposed Solution

Integrate React Query as a centralized data synchronization layer between our UI, SQLite persistence, and NDK/Nostr communication.

### Key Benefits

1. **Stabilized Authentication**
   - Consistent hook ordering regardless of auth state
   - Proper state transitions with React Query's state management
   - Better error propagation for auth operations

2. **Enhanced Data Management**
   - Centralized caching with automatic invalidation
   - Standardized loading/error states
   - Consistent data access patterns

3. **Improved Offline Support**
   - Better background synchronization
   - Enhanced conflict resolution strategies
   - More resilient error recovery

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Simpler component implementation
   - Better type safety throughout the app
   - Easier testing and debugging

## Implementation Approach

We're planning a phased 8-week approach to minimize disruption:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Core infrastructure (Auth, Query Client)
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Social & Profile features (most critical areas)
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Workout & Exercise features
4. **Weeks 7-8**: System-wide integration & refinement

## Impact on Architecture

This integration preserves our existing architecture while enhancing its resilience:

- SQLite remains our primary persistence layer
- NDK continues as our Nostr communication layer
- Zustand stores remain for UI and active workout state
- React Query serves as the synchronization layer between these components
