- [Encoding and Decoding](./encoding_decoding.md) - NIP-19 encoding and decoding processes

## Nostr Protocol Overview

The Nostr protocol provides a decentralized social networking protocol that underpins the social features of the POWR app. Key aspects include:

- Relay-based message distribution
- Public key cryptography for identity
- Event-based data model
- NIP standards for interoperability

## Implementation in POWR

Our implementation of Nostr follows these key principles:

1. Privacy-first approach with user control
2. Offline-first with queued publishing
3. Support for standard and extended event kinds
4. Proper event signing and verification
5. Relay management for optimal connectivity
