# NDK (Nostr Development Kit) Documentation

This section contains technical documentation specific to the Nostr Development Kit (NDK) implementation in the POWR app.

## Key Documents

- [Comprehensive Guide](./comprehensive_guide.md) - Complete reference for NDK implementation
- [Subscription Analysis](./subscription_analysis.md) - Analysis of subscription patterns and solutions
- [Encoding and Decoding](./encoding_decoding.md) - NIP-19 encoding and decoding processes

## Key NDK Concepts

NDK is the primary library we use for Nostr protocol integration. It provides:

- Connection and relay management
- Event creation, signing, and publishing
- Subscription management for receiving events
- User management and profile handling
- NIP-19 encoding and decoding utilities

## Implementation in POWR

Our implementation of NDK follows these key principles:

1. Singleton state management via Zustand store
2. Proper subscription lifecycle management
3. Centralized relay configuration
4. Clear authentication flow
5. Simplified implementation for MVP needs
